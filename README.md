# State Farm Distracted Driver Classification
## Satchel Grant

### Overview
This project consists of two notebooks. One uses TensorFlow and the other uses Keras running on TensorFlow to recognize and classify distracted drivers from the [State Farm Distracted Driver Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/state-farm-distracted-driver-detection) on Kaggle.

The Keras notebook is more clearly developed and includes far more methods for success. Please read that one.
